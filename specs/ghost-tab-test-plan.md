# Ghost Tab Test Plan

## Application Overview

Ghost Tab is a terminal and tmux wrapper application with no web-facing UI. It consists of two layers: a Go TUI binary (ghost-tab-tui) built with Bubbletea that drives interactive terminal menus, and a bash orchestration layer (bin/ghost-tab, lib/*.sh) that manages process lifecycle, config files, and tmux sessions. The application has no HTML pages, HTTP server, browser UI, REST API, or documentation site. There is therefore no surface area for Playwright browser automation in the conventional sense. This test plan documents the mismatch, describes every interactive TUI screen and bash-driven flow in the application, and provides a blueprint for the functional test scenarios that the existing Go and bash test suites should cover. If a web front-end is added to Ghost Tab in the future (for example a settings dashboard served over localhost, or a GitHub Pages documentation site), this plan can be re-activated and the steps below can be directly translated into Playwright tests.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Applicability Assessment

**Seed:** `seed.spec.ts`

#### 1.1. Confirm no web UI is present

**File:** `tests/applicability/no-web-ui.spec.ts`

**Steps:**
  1. Verify that the repository contains no HTML, CSS, or client-side JavaScript files other than the Playwright seed stub
    - expect: A search of the repository for *.html, *.htm, *.css, *.jsx, *.tsx, *.vue files returns zero results
    - expect: The only TypeScript file present is the empty seed.spec.ts stub, which contains no test logic
  2. Verify that no HTTP server is started by any script or Go binary in the project
    - expect: Searching lib/*.sh, bin/ghost-tab, and wrapper.sh for 'http', 'serve', 'listen', ':8080', ':3000', 'localhost' returns no matches
    - expect: The ghost-tab-tui binary subcommands (main-menu, select-project, add-project, confirm, settings-menu, select-ai-tool, multi-select-ai-tool, select-terminal, select-branch, show-logo) all write to stdout and read from a TTY — they expose no TCP port
  3. Verify that no Playwright configuration file exists in the repository
    - expect: No playwright.config.ts or playwright.config.js file is present
    - expect: The package.json does not exist, confirming there is no Node.js dependency graph beyond the npx-invoked MCP server

### 2. Go TUI: Main Menu

**Seed:** `seed.spec.ts`

#### 2.1. Display project list on launch

**File:** `tests/main-menu/display-project-list.spec.ts`

**Steps:**
  1. Launch ghost-tab-tui main-menu with a projects file containing two entries: 'my-app:/home/user/my-app' and 'web-service:/home/user/web'
    - expect: The terminal renders the Ghost Tab header with the animated ghost ASCII art
    - expect: Both project names 'my-app' and 'web-service' appear in the list
    - expect: The first project is highlighted as the selected item
    - expect: The action footer shows the key hints: A (add), D (delete), O (open once), P (plain terminal)
    - expect: The hint line shows: up/down navigate, Enter select
  2. Verify the ghost animation cycles between awake and sleeping states
    - expect: The ghost image changes between the open-eyed and closed-eyed variants on a timer
    - expect: The animation does not produce visual artifacts or break the layout

#### 2.2. Navigate projects with arrow keys

    - expect: The cursor jumps directly to the third project without pressing Enter
  2. Press the '1' key
    - expect: The cursor jumps to the first project
  3. Press a number higher than the project count, for example '9' when only five projects exist
    - expect: No crash occurs
    - expect: The cursor does not move to a non-existent position

#### 2.4. Select a project with Enter

**File:** `tests/main-menu/select-project-enter.spec.ts`

    - expect: The bash orchestration layer receives the JSON and launches the tmux session for that project

#### 2.5. Quit with Escape or Ctrl-C

**File:** `tests/main-menu/quit-escape.spec.ts`
